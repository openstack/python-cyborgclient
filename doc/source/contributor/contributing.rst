So You Want to Contribute...
============================
For general information on contributing to OpenStack, please check out the
`contributor guide <https://docs.openstack.org/contributors/>`_ to get started.
It covers all the basics that are common to all OpenStack projects: the accounts
you need, the basics of interacting with our Gerrit review system, how we
communicate as a community, etc.
Below will cover the more project specific information you need to get started
with python-cyborgclient.

Communication

* IRC channel #openstack-cyborg at OFTC
* Mailing list (prefix subjects with ``[cyborg]`` for faster responses)

Please refer the `python-cyborgclient Core Team

Task Tracking

patch by giving ``Workflow +1`` vote.

All common PTL duties are enumerated in the `PTL guide
